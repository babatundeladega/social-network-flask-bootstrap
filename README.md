# Social Network Flask Bootstrap

## Introduction
Python's web frameworks (**Bottle**, **Django**, **Flask**, **Tornado**, **Web.py**) power quite a fraction of the world's most visited sites -- [Pinterest](www.pinterest.com), [Reddit](www.reddit.com), [Quora](www.quora.com) & [DropBox](www.dropbox.com) amongst a rather long list. A vast majority of these sites _(including [Instagram](www.instagram.com))_ are built in [Django](www.djangoproject.com) -- because of its batteries included philosophy.

[Instagram](www.instagram.com), founded in 2010 and perhaps the fastest growing social network, most interestingly have their own custom-built version of Django -- which possesses several middlewares they were able to build because of Django's mutability features. Instagram growing to be one of the world's most used social networks, makes me both proud to be a _pythonista_ and slightly envious it wasn't built in Flask.

Flask is simple, flexible and has a certain fine-grained control. These peculiar qualities are why I picked it over Django as the framework I wanted to be a ninja with. Now, being the ninja I once aspired to be, I set out to build a simple version of **Instagram with all of its signatory features (Stories, Collections, Direct Messaging, etc)**.

So, for all interested in building the next big social network, here is something to get you started.
